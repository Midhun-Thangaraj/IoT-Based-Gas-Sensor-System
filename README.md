SMART GAS DETECTION SYSTEM

This project proposes a wearable IoT-based gas detection system to enhance worker safety in industrial environments. Using NodeMCU ESP8266 and MQ-series sensors, the system continuously monitors harmful gases and provides real-time alerts. When gas levels exceed safety thresholds, a buzzer and LED indicate danger, and alerts are sent via the Blynk IoT platform. Sensor data is also stored in a MySQL database for monitoring. This cost-effective and portable solution ensures early detection of hazardous gases, improving workplace safety.
